	  <p class="section-content">I'm a pretty simple guy who knows what he likes and how he likes it. I've always liked building things, be it a computer or a castle with legos. I've jumped around in regards to what I want to do with my life over the years, finally I settled on programming. It's something I've always gone back to and it's been a passion of mine for many years.</p>

	I love playing video games. I used to stream on twitch.tv, but stopped to persue my career change and new goal in life. I like to play/run Dungeons and Dragons. Like to watch movies and TV Shows. Basically I'm a big geek. Wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
